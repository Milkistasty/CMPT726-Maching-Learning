Let $A$ be an $2\times2$ matrix. Suppose the singular value decomposition of $A$ is $I \Sigma V^\top$, where $I$ is the identity matrix. Let $\vec{v}_1$ and $\vec{v}_2$ denote the right-singular vectors of $A$, which are associated with the singular values 5 and 2 respectively. Consider a vector $\vec{\beta} = 3\vec{v}_1 - \vec{v}_2$. \textbf{What is $A\vec{\beta}$?} Show your work.
